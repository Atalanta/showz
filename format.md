FoodFightShow
=============

The main foodfightshow is a panel show modeled after [the ruby
rogues](http://rubyrogues.com). More than 5 participants is difficult
to handle, or at least each individual participant has much less
opportunity to talk.

Purpose
-------

1. To summarize important development in Chef community on ML, chat,
 conferences for busy people who can't necessarily be there or read
 the ML everyday
2. For fun!
3. Discuss w/ really smart people about subjects that are of interest
 to the general Chef community but not necessarily chef-related. For example, Ilumos, server orchestration, different virtualization
technologies
4. Help people in community feel like they “know” prominent community members
5. Introduce Chef to new users
