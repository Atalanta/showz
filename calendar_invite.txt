This episode of the Food Fight Show will be hosted via Google+ Hangout.  The Hangout will be streamed live on YouTube and then the audio will be extracted and released as a podcast episode.

If you have a google account, please send me your google ID so that I can add you to the Food Fight Show's circles, and my own.  The Food Fight Show's Google+ Name is "Bryan Nathen" because of the rules for setting up a Google+ account.

You will receive the URL for the hangout shortly before it begins, probably about 15 minutes prior to our start time.

Please use a USB headset if you have one available.  Muting yourself while not speaking is always appreciated and helps with the quality of the show.  

The beginning of an outline can be found in our github page [1].  We'd love to see feedback, pull requests, etc. on the show notes.  At a minimum, please let me know what links you'd like to include in the "Panel" section.  We typically include your name, twitter, github, and IRC handles plus a link to your blog.  If you'd like we will include your title and company, too.

We include a "picks" section at the end of each episode so please come prepared with a pick or two as well.  The picks could be anything:  a protip, a tool, a book, a beer, whatever.  Something technical or non-technical that you've been using or interested in lately that you'd like to share.


Thanks!
Bryan & Nathen
