## In the News

* Productivity is the greatest scourge a workplace can face. You want to make sure your workers arenâ€™t too productive, but how do you do that?  Fear not!  Jeremy Bingham just wrote up a [blog post](http://time.to.pullthepl.ug/blog/2012/5/21/a-chef-cookbook-for-dwarf-fortress/) that will help!  The blog post announces a new [Chef Cookbook](https://github.com/ctdk/dwarf_fortress) that will install and manage Dwarf Fortress on your workstation.

* [Matt Ray](http://twitter.com/mattray) released Spiceweasel 1.1.  This release adds support for extracting knife/json/yaml infrastructure & Ruby 1.8 support.  I was able to attend Matt's [#ChefConf presentation on Spiceweasel](http://www.slideshare.net/mattray/chefconf-2012-spiceweasel) and we're starting to use it this week.  Definitely worth checking out.

* Over on [CIO.com](http://www.cio.com/), they've posted an article suggesting that IT has figured out the development process but the "bookends" of Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) are where the most help is needed.  Check the show notes for a link to the article: [IT Should Forget Development, Focus on Requirements and Release Management](http://www.cio.com/article/706656/IT_Should_Forget_Development_Focus_on_Requirements_and_Release_Management)

* What do chimps and 90's-era R&B star Montell Jordan have in common?  They both like to tell the world "how they do it."  Over on the [Infochimps blog](http://blog.infochimps.com), [Nathaniel Eliot](http://twitter.com/temujin9) posted an article titled [How We Do It](http://blog.infochimps.com/2012/05/18/how-we-do-it/).  The article is a look at the hiring process, management style, career development, and more.  A great read for any team working in this space.

* [John Willis](http://twitter.com/botchagalupe) has written a two-part series on Devops culture on the [IT Revolution Press](http://itrevolution.com/) blog.  Check the show notes for links to [part one](http://itrevolution.com/devops-culture-part-1/) and [part two](http://itrevolution.com/devops-culture-part-2/).

* Are you looking for some reasons to implement Puppet?  Over on the Tribily  blog, you'll find [8 reasons to implement Configuration Management using Puppet](http://tribily.com/blog/2011/12/07/8-reasons-implement-configuration-management-using-puppet).  Of course, these 8 reasons apply equally well to Chef and can serve as a nice way to help convince your team that automated configuration management with Chef or Puppet is the "right" way to go.

* [Zac Stevens](http://twitter.com/zts) is back with another post on his [Cryptocracy](http://www.cryptocracy.com) blog this one will show you [how ubuntu-vm-buildercan be used to go from zero to fully-installed Chef client in under 2 minutes.](http://www.cryptocracy.com/blog/2012/05/12/bootstrapping-chef/) 

* There's a new post on [Evolving towards cookbook reusability in Chef](http://realityforge.org/code/2012/05/12/evolving-towards-cookbook-reusability-in-chef.html).  Find the article on the [RealityForge](http://realityforge.org/) blog and a link in the show notes.
  
* The Godfather of DevOps, [Patrick Debois](http://twitter.com/patrickdebois) is back with another thought-provoking and detailed blog post:  [Devops Areas - Codifying devops practices](http://jedi.be/blog/2012/05/12/codifying-devops-area-practices/).  This is a first stab at providing a structure to codify devops practices.  The wording, descriptions are pretty much work in progress, but he's looking for your feedback.  Checkout the article and let Patrick know what you think.

* [Jesse Robbins](http://twitter.com/jesserobbins) was recently interviewed by O'Reilly Radar  on the [state of infrastructure automation](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/05/infrastructure-automation-jesse-robbins.html).

* [Andrew Crump](http://twitter.com/#!/acrmp) released [version 1.3.0](https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#130-21st-may-2012) of foodcritic. It features a number of bug fixes and new features such as FC026: Conditional execution block attribute contains only string rule added (related issue). Thanks to [@mkocher](https://twitter.com/#!/mkocher) for proposing this rule. Foodcritic now accepts multiple cookbook paths as arguments and supports linting of individual files only. Big thanks to [@cgriego](https://twitter.com/#!/cgriego) for these changes. These lay the groundwork for his new [guard-foodcritic project](http://rubygems.org/gems/guard-foodcritic).

* [Andrew Crump](http://twitter.com/#!/acrmp) plans to extend foodcritic so that it can critique roles and environments. He would like to know what kind of rules you would like to see implemented. You can give him suggestions on this github issue for [foodcritic](https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic/issues/19).

* The last item in our news for today is a link to the Food Fight github account and to a page where we've been collecting a list of slides, videos, and follow-up blog posts from #ChefConf.  Checkout some of the great content from the conference.  I you have something that should be added to the list, or know someone who does, pleas submit a pull request!

## Cookbook Updates

14 new cookbooks were added to the community site since our last episode.  That's almost one new cookbook per day!

### [forkable_client](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/forkable_client) v0.0.1 - [chrisroberts](http://community.opscode.com/users/chrisroberts)
  * Like modifying code on the fly? Like reworking internals of running code to do interesting things? Like not losing a huge chunk of memory because some jerk cookbook decided to load a 100M json file just for the hell of it? Then this cookbook is for you!
  * This cookbook adds forking support to chef-client runs. It is based on the work within [CHEF-3104](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3104). After this cookbook has loaded, client runs will fork themselves and then converge. What this provides is less worry about what cookbooks may be doing (and loading) that is going to bloat out the memory of the process. It's just that simple.
