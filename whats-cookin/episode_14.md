## In the News

* Productivity is the greatest scourge a workplace can face. You want to make 
  sure your workers arenâ€™t too productive, but how do you do that?  Fear not!  
  Jeremy Bingham just wrote up a [blog post](http://time.to.pullthepl.ug/blog/2012/5/21/a-chef-cookbook-for-dwarf-fortress/)
  that will help!  The blog post announces a new [Chef Cookbook](https://github.com/ctdk/dwarf_fortress)
  that will install and manage Dwarf Fortress on your workstation.

* [Matt Ray](http://twitter.com/mattray) released Spiceweasel 1.1.  This release adds support for extracting knife/json/yaml infrastructure & Ruby 1.8 support.  I was able to attend Matt's [#ChefConf presentation on Spiceweasel](http://www.slideshare.net/mattray/chefconf-2012-spiceweasel) and we're starting to use it this week.  Definitely worth checking out.

* Over on [CIO.com](http://www.cio.com/), they've posted an article suggesting 
  that IT has figured out the development process but the "bookends" of 
  Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) are where the most help is needed.  
  Check the show notes for a link to the article:
  [IT Should Forget Development, Focus on Requirements and Release Management](http://www.cio.com/article/706656/IT_Should_Forget_Development_Focus_on_Requirements_and_Release_Management)

* What do chimps and 90's-era R&B star Montell Jordan have in common?  They 
  both like to tell the world "how they do it."  Over on the 
  [Infochimps blog](http://blog.infochimps.com), [Nathaniel Eliot](http://twitter.com/temujin9)
  posted an article titled [How We Do It](http://blog.infochimps.com/2012/05/18/how-we-do-it/).
  The article is a look at the hiring process, management style, career 
  development, and more.  A great read for any team working in this space.
