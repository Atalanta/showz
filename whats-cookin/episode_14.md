## In the News

* Productivity is the greatest scourge a workplace can face. You want to make 
  sure your workers arenâ€™t too productive, but how do you do that?  Fear not!  
  Jeremy Bingham just wrote up a [blog post](http://time.to.pullthepl.ug/blog/2012/5/21/a-chef-cookbook-for-dwarf-fortress/)
  that will help!  The blog post announces a new [Chef Cookbook](https://github.com/ctdk/dwarf_fortress)
  that will install and manage Dwarf Fortress on your workstation.

* [Matt Ray](http://twitter.com/mattray) released Spiceweasel 1.1.  This release adds support for extracting knife/json/yaml infrastructure & Ruby 1.8 support.  I was able to attend Matt's [#ChefConf presentation on Spiceweasel](http://www.slideshare.net/mattray/chefconf-2012-spiceweasel) and we're starting to use it this week.  Definitely worth checking out.

* Over on [CIO.com](http://www.cio.com/), they've posted an article suggesting 
  that IT has figured out the development process but the "bookends" of 
  Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) are where the most help is needed.  
  Check the show notes for a link to the article:
  [IT Should Forget Development, Focus on Requirements and Release Management](http://www.cio.com/article/706656/IT_Should_Forget_Development_Focus_on_Requirements_and_Release_Management)

* What do chimps and 90's-era R&B star Montell Jordan have in common?  They 
  both like to tell the world "how they do it."  Over on the 
  [Infochimps blog](http://blog.infochimps.com), [Nathaniel Eliot](http://twitter.com/temujin9)
  posted an article titled [How We Do It](http://blog.infochimps.com/2012/05/18/how-we-do-it/).
  The article is a look at the hiring process, management style, career 
  development, and more.  A great read for any team working in this space.

* [John Willis](http://twitter.com/botchagalupe) has written a two-part 
  series on Devops culture on the [IT Revolution Press](http://itrevolution.com/) 
  blog.  Check the show notes for links to [part one](http://itrevolution.com/devops-culture-part-1/)
  and [part two](http://itrevolution.com/devops-culture-part-2/)

* Are you looking for some reasons to implement Puppet?  Over on the Tribily
  blog, you'll find [8 reasons to implement Configuration Management using Puppet](http://tribily.com/blog/2011/12/07/8-reasons-implement-configuration-management-using-puppet).
  Of course, these 8 reasons apply equally well to Chef and can serve as a
  nice way to help convince your team that automated configuration management
  with Chef or Puppet is the "right" way to go.

* [Zac Stevens](http://twitter.com/zts) is back with another post on his
  [Cryptocracy](http://www.cryptocracy.com) blog this one will show you 
  [how ubuntu-vm-buildercan be used to go from zero to fully-installed Chef client in under 2 minutes.](http://www.cryptocracy.com/blog/2012/05/12/bootstrapping-chef/)

* There's a new post on [Evolving towards cookbook reusability in Chef](http://realityforge.org/code/2012/05/12/evolving-towards-cookbook-reusability-in-chef.html).
  Find the article on the [RealityForge](http://realityforge.org/) blog and
  a link in the show notes.

* The Godfather of DevOps, [Patrick Debois](http://twitter.com/patrickdebois) 
  is back with another thought-provoking and detailed blog post:  
  [Devops Areas - Codifying devops practices](http://jedi.be/blog/2012/05/12/codifying-devops-area-practices/).
  This is a first stab at providing a structure to codify devops practices. 
  The wording, descriptions are pretty much work in progress, but he's looking
  for your feedback.  Checkout the article and let Patrick know what you think.
