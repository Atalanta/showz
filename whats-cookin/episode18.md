## Cookbook Updates

#### [spice v1.0.0](https://github.com/danryan/spice) complete rewrite!
* Returned results are now full interactive objects and not just hashes. Create, update, and destroy resources with an ORM-like interface.
* Note: this version of Spice is a major version bump, which means it is not backwards-compatible with previous versions.
