## In the News

* [Carlos Sanchez](http://twitter.com/csanchez) recently wrote a blog post titled [Learning Puppet or Chef? Check out Vagrant!](http://blog.carlossanchez.eu/2012/03/29/learning-puppet-or-chef-check-out-vagrant/) it starts off with a very simple idea "If you are starting to use Puppet or Chef, you must have Vagrant." From there, it provides a quick intro to getting started with Vagrant.

* [Huang Liang](https://twitter.com/#!/exceedhl) added a wiki to github that describes a process for [using toft and cucumber to test Chef cookbooks](https://github.com/exceedhl/toft/wiki/How-to-use-toft-gem-and-cucumber-to-test-chef-cookbooks)

* ...and now for a bit of shamless self-promotion... RailsConf 2012 was held last week in Austin.  Many of the talks included information on how people are running their Rails apps in production.  [Nathen Harvey](http://twitter.com/nathenharvey) gave a talk about [How Operations Enables Developer Productivity](http://speakerdeck.com/u/nathenharvey/p/taming-the-kraken-how-operations-enables-developer-productivity).  Slides are available on Speaker Deck and videos of this and all other RailsConf presentations will be available soon.  **Update** [video is now available here](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/882-railsconf2012-taming-the-kraken-how-operations-enables-developer-productivity).
