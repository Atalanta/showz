* [On Resilience in Automated Systems](http://www.paperplanes.de/2012/7/10/on-resilience-in-automated-systems-failures-and-human-factor.html) by Matthias Meyer - would be a great topic for the show

* [vim replace string for FC001](http://bit.ly/M4BbgH)

* [Monitoring Sucks. But Monitoring as Testing Sucks a Lot More](http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2012/07/monitoring-sucks-but-monitoring-as.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter)

* [logstash + you + me](https://gist.github.com/3088552) a nice gist that is actually a letter to the logstash and larger devops community written by Jordan Sissel, one of the founders of the logstash project. One of the things that Jordan points out, that it would make financial sense for someone to pay him to work full-time on logstash rather than paying for splunk licenses. Hey Github! I think we have found your next Githubber.

* [librarian-chef vs
  berkshelf](http://christian-trabold.de/librarian-chef-vs-berkshelf)

* [Visualizing log data with Logstash, statsd, and Graphite](http://blog.pkhamre.com/2012/07/05/visualizing-logdata-with-logstash-statsd-and-graphite/) great blog post from Pal Christian Hamre

* Great discussion on the mailing list between Brian Bianco, Jay Feldblum, and Peter Donald. How to propagate notifications from an LWRP if
resources w/in an LWRP have changes. Peter Donald wrote  new provider [notifying_action](http://realityforge.org/code/2012/07/17/lwrp-notify-on-changed-resources.html) and blog post based on Yfeldblum's gist to deal w/ this issue.
