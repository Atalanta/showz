## Now with TravisCI & Foodcritic...

Bryan, have you noticed the recent trend with adding TravisCI build status widgets to a cookbook's README?  Most of them are using TravisCI to run Foodcritic tests.  About 30% of the cookbooks we've mentioned today have TravisCI integration.  I think you recently set this up for the minitest-handler cookbook.  How difficult was it?
