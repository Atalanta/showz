* [Bryan Berry](http://twitter.comy/bryanwb) started a discussion over on the [Chef mailing list](http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2012-05/msg00000.html) about the conflict he's seeing between using environments to manage cookbook releases and to manage application environments.  In the thread, [Peter Donald](http://community.opscode.com/users/peter_donald) shared a [gist how he uses a recipe at the beginning of each chef run to verify that cookbooks are frozen and specified in non development environments](https://gist.github.com/2048310).
