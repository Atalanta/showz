## In the News

* Oh, no!  I have a node that hasn't checked in with Chef server for days!  Why didn't I know about that?  I'll have to start using [knife ohno](http://rubygems.org/gems/knife-ohno), a knife plugin and now a ruby gem from [Mandi Walls](http://twitter.com/lnxchk).  `gem install knife-ohno` then find any node whose last check-in is more than six hours old using `knife ohno 6`
* [Asgard: Web-based Cloud Management and Deployments](http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/06/asgard-web-based-cloud-management-and.html), open-sourced by Netflix, their custom Grails tool for deploying Netflix applications and infrastructure to Amazon. Bryan's opinion: Netflix doesn't use Puppet or Chef because they have essentially written their own CM framework in Groovy.
* [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) tool for managing cookbook or an application's cookbook dependencies, from Jamie Winsor and company at RiotGames. Looks quite similar to librarian-chef.
* [Etsy dashboard](https://github.com/etsy/dashboard) source code for Etsy's dashboards framework
* [Puppet Feature #778](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/7788) extending Puppet via rubygems
* Opscode and Google I/O rumor, hopefully will be reality by show date
* [Tips for Vagrant and Chef](http://techportal.inviqa.com/2012/06/26/tips-for-vagrant-and-chef/) from Nick Peirson at Inviqa
* [Chef for Openstack](http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/06/27/chef-for-openstack/)
* [Project Glass](https://plus.google.com/111626127367496192147/posts) that is the most exciting thing I have seen in a long-time. What does Project Glass have to do w/ DevOps? Well, behind every mobile technology like this one are a ton of backend services. Who keeps these services running? We do. Operations teams. As people continue to integrate technology into their lives, we are going to have a lot more opportunities and a lot more responsibility.
