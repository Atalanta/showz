* Mission Accomplished! Jordan Sissel has a new gig at
  [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com) working full-time on
  [logstash](http://logsta.sh) He blogged about what he intends to do
  to
  [grow logstash's value](http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/growing-logstash-value.html)

* [Seth Vargo](http://twitter.com/sethvargo) has released the first 
  non-alpha version of [fauxhai](https://github.com/customink/fauxhai) 
  the node-mocking gem. This version implements the `fetch` feature, 
  which allows you to download ohai data from a real remote node and 
  run your tests against that data.
* The team over at Boundary has released [small wonder](https://github.com/boundary/small_wonder),
  a deployment tool.  It's a lightweight wrapper around [salticid](https://github.com/aphyr/salticid)
  Small Wonder is a means for using Salticid and Chef together to 
  deploy applications.  Small Wonder consumes your knife.rb so has
  access to anything that any other chef-client can access, including
  Chef search.
* Graphite's time shift function - what's that all about?  what makes
  it pure awesomeness?

  a rewrite of the original and now has an accompanying Chef repo.

  not!  Checkout [Brooklyn Integers](http://brooklynintegers.com/)
  it's an IaaS (Integer as a Service) a simple API for generating
  and retrieving integers.  If you think the integers in Brooklyn are

  [Mission Integers](http://www.missionintegers.com/).
