## Introduction
For this DevOps Delicacy, I met with [David Bock](https://github.com/bokmann) to talk about the Chef Introductory Workshop.  We met before, during, and after the course and discussed David's expectations of the class, prior experience with Chef, thoughts on the class and more.  Let's get to the interviews.
