 "golang" becoming the dominant language in PAAS, IAAS, orchestration
 w/in 24 months. Why? can't we get the job done w/ Ruby (cloudfoundry) or
  python (openstack). Why not invest more in ruby by financing
  projects like Rubinius?
** Is Apcera basing its platform on golang?
** do u foresee cf as a whole transitioning to golang?
** Could u foresee openstack doing the same?
** Don't use miss the ability to create a DSL after moving to golang
from ruby?
** Why not Rust instead of golang?
** What would the rise of golang mean for operations people?
** Do you believe that it could displace java and C# as the mainstays
  of enterprise programming?
** Do you do your scripting in ruby or golang?
* BOSH
** what is BOSH? Does Apcera use it?
** Does it serve any purpose outside of cf?
** What does it do that Chef doesn't? What can Chef learn from BOSH?
** Does BOSH or cf have any orchestration tooling?
** What does Apcera use for orchestration?
