### Big Data Without Big Databaseâ€”Extreme In-Memory Caching

These days it is not uncommon to have 100s of gigabytes of data that must be sliced and diced, then delivered fast and rendered quickly. Typically solutions involve lots of caching and expensive hardware with lots of memory. And, while those solutions certainly can work, they aren't always cost effective, or feasible in certain environments (like in the cloud). This talk seeks to cover some strategies for caching large data sets without tons of expensive hardware, but through software and data design.

It's common wisdom that serving your data from memory dramatically improves application performance and is a key to scaling. However, caching large datasets brings its own challenges: distribution, consistency, dealing with memory limits, and optimizing data loading just to name a few. This talk will go through some of the challenges, and solutions, to achieve fast data queries in the cloud. The audience will come away armed with a number of practical techniques for organizing and building caches for non-transactional datasets that can be applied to scale existing systems, or design new systems.


* Please introduce yourself to our audience. Where do you work, what's your role, etc.
* What did you present at Surge?
* Can you tell us more about how Decide is using big data to solve problems for consumers?
  * What's in your technology stack?
* You also help curate the Technology and Leadership Newsletter.
  * What is TLN?
  * How does one subscribe?
  * How do you find your articles?
* At last year's Surge, you talked about scaling Rails.  One of the things I remember most about that talk was the idea of creating v1s and v2s.  Can you talk about this idea a bit?
* Infrastructure as Code - The Food Fight Show is generally focused on topics of interest to anyone interested in "DevOps" but we also have a bias towards Chef. It would be interesting to hear about the tools you're using for managing your infrastructure.
