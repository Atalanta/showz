## Changes for 2013

As we look forward to 2013, there are a couple of things that we're going
to change:

1.  Whenever feasible, episodes will now be recorded via Google+ Hangout
    with a live stream posted to YouTube.
1.  We will try to keep the show length to about one hour.
1.  We will start a regular Food Fight Show newsletter which will include
    the content from the What's Cookin' section and any other noteworthy items.
    You can [subscribe to the newsletter now](http://bit.ly/ffsmail).

The [listener
survey](https://s3.amazonaws.com/foodfightshow/Survey+Results.pdf)
gave us some ideas about what sort of topics you'd like to see covered on
the show.  We'll work to line-up those topics and would really appreciate
your help in doing so.  Is there someone you really want to hear from?  A
topic you'd really like to see covered?  Please let us know!



Thank You!

We really appreciate all of the time you've put in listening to the show in
2012.  We hope to see you at [#ChefConf 2013](http://chefconf.opscode.com)
and other conferences throughout the year.

Thanks to all of our AWESOME guests through out the year!

We'd also like to thank [Opscode](http://www.opscode.com) for their
continued support of the show.  They cover our hosting and bandwidth costs
and allow their employees to participate on the show on a regular basis.
