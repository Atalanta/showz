Outline/Questions
-----------------
**Nathen:**  Bryan, you started the Food Fight Show in January of 2012.
We're approaching the one year anniversary of the show.  Take us back to
the beginning of the year.  Why did you start the Food Fight Show?  How
well has it met the objectives you set?

## Review of 2012
* Food Fight Show
  * 57 Food Fight Show Episodes 
  * 40,000 downloads which is about 700 downloads for each episode
  * 4 Google+ Hangouts with about 900 views
  * Used Hangout + Live Stream to YouTube for our last episode & released 
    the episode as an audio podcast
  * Nathen's Five favorite shows:
    1. [Episode 11: Etsy Examined, How the Best Do Their Business](http://foodfightshow.org/2012/05/episode-11-etsy-examined-how-best-do.html)
    1. [Episode 14: Post-Mortems with David Zwieback, John Allspaw, and Mike Rembetsy](http://foodfightshow.org/2012/05/episode-14-live-post-mortem-with-david.html)
    2. [Episode 18: Monitoringsucks](http://foodfightshow.org/2012/06/episode-18-monitoringsucks-with-lusis.html)
    1. [Episode 24: Jamie Winsor and Michael Ivey on Berkshelf](http://foodfightshow.org/2012/08/jamie-winsor-and-michael-ivey-skool-us-on-berkshelf.html)
    1. [Episode 25: ChatOps at Github with Jesse Newland](http://foodfightshow.org/2012/08/chatops-at-github-with-jesse-newland.html)
  * Bryan's list is almost exactly the same!
  * Listener survey - A quick summary of the [survey results is now available](https://s3.amazonaws.com/foodfightshow/Survey+Results.pdf).
* Big Changes for Opscode &amp; Chef
  * Opscode cookbooks moved to individual repositories
  * $19.5m Series C Funding 
  * #ChefConf 2012
  * Omnibus Chef Packaging - the easiest and best way to install Chef
    client
  * Chef gets new versioning.  What would have been 0.10.12 was released as
    10.12.0 making it easier for patch releases
  * erchef and Chef 11 Server Preview
  * [docs.opscode.com](http://docs.opscode.com)
  * Partial search for Opscode Hosted Chef
  * Community Summit 2
  * Testing cookbooks matures
    * foodcritic
    * test kitchen
    * etc., etc.
  * Nathen Harvey joined Opscode as community evangelist. Ah yeah!!!

## Hopes and dreams for 2013
  * Orchestration for deploys and better orchestration in general
  * Opscode provides test-kitchen CI to cookbooks developed by the community - as a service, across at least debian + redhat, but bsd support would be awesome
  * Some consensus on cookbook workflow(s) 
  * erChef is widely deployed, implemented, and battle-hardened

## Changes for 2013


As we look forward to 2013, there are a couple of things that we're going
to change:

1.  Whenever feasible, episodes will now be recorded via Google+ Hangout
    with a live stream posted to YouTube.
1.  We will try to keep length of the what's cookin' plus topic discussion to about one hour. The Picks section is our time to be self-indulgent and it may spill over one hour. You are welcome to hit the stop button at that point and switch to something more substantive.
1.  We will start a regular Food Fight Show newsletter which will include
    the content from the What's Cookin' section and any other noteworthy items.
    You can [subscribe to the newsletter now](http://bit.ly/ffsmail).
1.  Alternate episodes w/ interactive hangouts??
1.  Bryan will make a conscious effort to interrupt the guests less
1.  The Food Fight theme song is awesome but many of our hosts and
    panelists are music lovers.  We'll start using different music between
    What's Cookin' and the Interview and new music at the close of the show.
    We'll ask our guests for suggestions or pull a gem out of our hosts'
playlists.

The [listener
survey](https://s3.amazonaws.com/foodfightshow/Survey+Results.pdf)
gave us some ideas about what sort of topics you'd like to see covered on
the show.  We'll work to line-up those topics and would really appreciate
your help in doing so.  Is there someone you really want to hear from?  A
topic you'd really like to see covered?  Please let us know!



Thank You!
---------

We really appreciate all of the time you've put in listening to the show in
2012.  We hope to see you at [#ChefConf 2013](http://chefconf.opscode.com)
and other conferences throughout the year.

Thanks to all of our AWESOME guests through out the year!

We'd also like to thank [Opscode](http://www.opscode.com) for their
continued support of the show.  They cover our hosting and bandwidth costs
and allow their employees to participate on the show on a regular basis.
