Outline/Questions
-----------------
**Nathen:**  Bryan, you started the Food Fight Show in January of 2012.
We're approaching the one year anniversary of the show.  Take us back to

## Changes for 2013

As we look forward to 2013, there are a couple of things that we're going
to change:

1.  Whenever feasible, episodes will now be recorded via Google+ Hangout
    with a live stream posted to YouTube.
1.  We will try to keep length of the what's cookin' plus topic discussion to about one hour. The Picks section is our time to be self-indulgent and it may spill over one hour. You are welcome to hit the stop button at that point and switch to something more substantive.
1.  We will start a regular Food Fight Show newsletter which will include
    the content from the What's Cookin' section and any other noteworthy items.
    You can [subscribe to the newsletter now](http://bit.ly/ffsmail).
1.  Alternate episodes w/ interactive hangouts??
1.  Bryan will make a conscious effort to interrupt the guests less

The [listener
survey](https://s3.amazonaws.com/foodfightshow/Survey+Results.pdf)
gave us some ideas about what sort of topics you'd like to see covered on
the show.  We'll work to line-up those topics and would really appreciate
your help in doing so.  Is there someone you really want to hear from?  A
topic you'd really like to see covered?  Please let us know!



Thank You!
---------

We really appreciate all of the time you've put in listening to the show in
2012.  We hope to see you at [#ChefConf 2013](http://chefconf.opscode.com)
and other conferences throughout the year.

Thanks to all of our AWESOME guests through out the year!

We'd also like to thank [Opscode](http://www.opscode.com) for their
continued support of the show.  They cover our hosting and bandwidth costs
and allow their employees to participate on the show on a regular basis.
