### [Big Data in the Small: Why N Tier Architectures Are an Antipattern](http://omniti.com/surge/2012/sessions/big-data-in-the-small-why-n-tier-architectures-are-an-antipattern)

* Michael, can you please introduce yourself to our listeners?  Where are you located?  Where do you work, and what's your role there?
* What will you be presenting at Surge?
* Can you give us a basic introduction to Hypermedia APIs?  What is a hypermedia API and why should I care?
* Many applications are build using an N Tier Architectures. I think
  most of our listeners are familiar with 3-tier architectures but can
  you be more specific about what an n-tier architecture is? What makes this architecture an antipattern?
* What sort of failure scenarios are avoided using the archicture you're employing?
* Surege is all about disaster porn.  What are some failure scenarios that are unique to hypermedia APIs and / or HTML5 microdata?
* The Food Fight Show usually includes some discussion of Chef.  What are you using at Xfinity to caputre and manage your infrastructure as code?
