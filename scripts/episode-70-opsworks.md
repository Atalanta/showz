Outline/Questions
-----------------

* What is Opsworks?

* What components of Chef does Opsworks use?  What version?
* Who's using Opsworks?
* What are some of the major differences between Opsworks and Chef?
* What operating systems does Opsworks work with?
* What versions of Chef are used?
* How does OpsWorks manage configuration drift?
  * Scenario:  something is set-up during the setup stage (mysql client), admin logs into the box and changes the mysql client configuration by hand.  How does the server get back to the desired state?
* Command line access to the various stages of the lifecycle?  For example can I kick off a deploy without using the web browser?
* Can I use cookbooks from the community site?
* Can I mix my own cookbooks and your cookbooks?
* What does the migration path look like?  From Chef-to-OpsWorks?  From OpsWorks-to-Chef Server?
