#### Why don't you introduce yourselves.

* Which versions Windows OS do you run? Win2k8? Win2k8 Server Core?

* What tools are typically used to manage Windows environments?
* cygwin, winRM, powershell, what's that lay of the land?

* How well does Ruby currently support Windows? Do parts of the Stdlib
 like FileUtils and Net::ssh, Net::*, work properly?

* What aspects of chef on Windows need the most improvement? What part
can Chef work on? What does MS need to improve

* Does Windows have a package manager yet? Or any way to resolve
package dependencies (.msi, chocolatey)?

application deployment?
* Do you use ssh keys in windowsland? If not how do your users log on?
* Do you use SSH on your windows machines?
* What is the state of the community around Windows-related cookbooks?
* How realistic is it that a given cookbook support both windows and linux? Is it even a good idea?
* What do you have to do to make a cookbook support both windows and linux?
