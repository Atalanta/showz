Outline/Questions
-----------------

* What is test-kitchen?
* How important is test-kitchen to the overall cookbook project?
* what kind of tests can I run w/ test-kitchen? What are the benefits
  of the different kinds of tests?
* how stable is test-kitchen? which oses/distros does it support?
* How are cookbook dependencies handled by test-kitchen?
* How can I contribute?
* What is bento?
* how do you use test-kitchen today?
* What is the future for test-kitchen?
* Do your foresee test-kitchen integrating w/ travis-ci?
* Why do I have to run `bundle exec kitchen` ?
* Is test-kitchen suitable for n00bs or too advanced?
* Test-kitchen is a _big_ project, who is working on it right now and
  how much time do you have for it. Will Opscode  budget dev time to
  speed it up?
* Mitchellh just merged in the machine-abstraction branch to vagrant,
  any chance Opscode will create a plugin for kvm or lxc?
* Test-kitchen currently depends on librarian, could berkshelf be used in place of librarian?
* Is test-kitchen necessarily chef-specific? could it be used to
  manage tests for other configuration management tools like cfengine
  or puppet?
* from commit log, test-kitchen was started back in February of this
  year, however it wasn't made public until recently. Why did you
  choose to develop it in private rather than in the open? esp. when
  some tools have complementary or overlapping functionality (i.e. berkshelf)?
* test-kitchen doesn't seem to have support for spinning up multiple
  vms simultaneously and testing their interaction. This would be esp. useful for
  spinning up a mysql cluster, for instance. Is this feature planned?
