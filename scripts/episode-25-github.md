b4 we proceed w/ asking a million questions? For instance, Etsy made 
special points about their "no blame" culture and their chef workflow.

Ur Setup

* Github is well known for running on bare metal, how do speed up the
  process of provisioning those systems? Do you have people onsite at
  datacenters to handle hardware faults?
* How much of your mental bandwidth is consumed by dealing w/ hardware
  stuff? For example, I can't keep up w/ all the issues in Ruby-land
  and the ones in hardware-land. Do only a few of your team deal w/ hw issues?
* if u have an outside company  handle hw, how well does that work and
  what are the challenges there?
* How do u do capacity planning?

* Since u guys do work at github, do you have any special git
  workflows or tricks that you would like to share?


Configuration Management
----------------------
