Outline/Questions
-----------------

* Survey time
 * who is using docker for testing?
 * who is using docker in production?
 * who is using it on baremetal & who in the cloud?
* Does docker remove the need for cfg mgmt tools like puppet & chef?
* If I were to avoid puppet & chef and just use dockerfiles, what does that look like?
* How does docker manage the differences b/w AUFS "commits" and does that introduce any 
extra overhead?
* How can i track down or audit all the changes that have been made to a docker image?
* Dysinger: using chef w/ docker? in preso noted that need to break chef run into 2 pieces
How could chef better support this?
* Dysinger: got sense from your preso that we need to provide developers w/ better abstraction so that they don't have to learn chef. How does that work? And how we still enforce basic security?
* if u run each app in its own docker container, what about daemons that need to interact 
with that app? such as collectd, logstash, statsd, etc.?
* When does it not make sense to use docker?
