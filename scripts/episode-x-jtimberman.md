Topic - Joshua Timberman, King of Sysadmins
==========================

* Where is training headed?
* What process does Opscode use for developing Cookbooks?
* Why are so many people obsessed with testing?
* What's happening with Kitchen (more testing)?
* What are the biggest recent changes to the opscode-cookbooks repo?
* What are the keys to writing reusable cookbooks?
* jtimberman-specific
  * Patrick DeBois may be the Godfather of DevOps but you are arguably
    the King of Sysadmins. What should your subjects know in order to
    succeed in this new world of DevOps/System Administration? Do you
    have any commandments to issue? (Thou shalt not . . .)
  * in the not-too-distant past you switched from vim to emacs? why was
    that? was it worth it? Should other sysadmins consider the switch?
  * I (Bryan) often argue that _all_ sysadmins should learn Ruby and
    use it as their default scripting language. Do you agree?
  * You have played a bit w/ SmartOS, is it far superior to Linux?
    should we all dump linux for Illumos? Or is the marginal benefit
    not enough?
  * What is your favorite linux distro and what is your default one?
  * What sucks about linux? what rocks about linux?
  * What are some new technologies/tools that are excited to play with?
* What resources are missing from the available defaults in the Chef
  DSL?
* What do you think about next-gen cm? What about actively asserting system state
  using inotify, dtrace or systemtap?
* The # of opscode-cookbooks just keeps growing, as do the # of
  tickets and pull requests, what is the plan for scaling up support
  of opscode-cookbooks?
