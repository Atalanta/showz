* What options are out there for continuous integration systems? There must be more that jenkins. What are the pros and cons of each?
* Is there anything worth learning besides git? Are there particular advantages that perforce, svn, or mercurial have over it?
* How might different git branching workflows relate to release engineering? tagging?
* What is backporting?
* How do you handle versioning and storage of large media files or many media files?
