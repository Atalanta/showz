### Introductions

Brought to you by...

#### Why don't you introduce yourselves.


Who are you?  Where are you working?  How can people get in touch with you?

### Windows

* Why does your company use a primarily Windows stack?
* Which versions Windows OS do you run? Win2k8? Win2k8 Server Core?
* How well does Chef currently support Windows?
* How receptive are windows admins to automation, esp. since
historically it has been harder to automate Windows, due to being GUI-centric
* How well does Ruby currently support Windows? Do parts of the Stdlib
 like FileUtils and Net::ssh, Net::*, work properly?
* Most *nix folks look down on the Windows Operating
System, perhaps unfairly. What are some good parts of the Windows OS that may
be new and perhaps unknown to *nix people?
* Tell us about powershell. Is it as good as or better than the *nix
shells? how well does it integrate with chef? What aout the upcoming
script_resource?
* What aspects of chef on Windows need the most improvement? What part
can Chef work on? What does MS need to improve
* What has been your experience teaching ruby to windows devs and sysadmins?
*
