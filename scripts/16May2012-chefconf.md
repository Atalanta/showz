Adam's opener

Why he started Chef
* Everyone 
ontologies - we can't categorize everything, we can't fit everything
to topologies


* Lusis talk on logstash 
* Sean Escriva on metrics + chef
   * using sensu, collectd, graphite, and gdash
   * key feature of sensu is that nodes can self-register
   * collectd for collecting data
   * send data collected by collectd to graphite
   * gdash as a pretty front-end to graphite
   * chef ties it all together, esp discovery library
  he calls the suite "echelon"
   * loved that he started at the high-level philosophy and got all
     the way into the details of the recipes and roles
   * loosely coupled components --> get enough components, you've got
    complexity, chef is key to managing that complexity
