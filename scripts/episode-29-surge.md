#### Build Your Own Database: Berkeley DB Java Edition at Yammer

Sometimes the solution to your problem can't be found on the shelf. That was the case one year ago for Yammer when rampaging growth forced us to move our messaging database from a 10+ billion row PostgreSQL database to something more reliable and scale ready. After several false starts with pre-built offerings, we constructed our own solution and shipped an embedded, distributed NoSQL data store built on top of Berkeley DB Java Edition. It was not a decision made lightly. Nor was it a particularly easy trail to blaze at times. In this session I'll discuss why Yammer chose to build vs. buy, what was built, problems encountered and where Yammer is today.

* Welcome, Ryan.  Please introduce yourself to our audience.  Where do you work, what's your role, etc.
* What are you presenting here at Surge?
* PostgreSQL is known for being reliable and scalable yet it didn't work for you.  What problems were you running into?
* What other solutions did you consider before deciding to build your own?
* What are your data access patterns?  Would a key-value store such as riak or redis been able to address your needs?
* What did you end up building?
* What have been some of the challenges in building your own data store?
